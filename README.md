Week7 Assignment

The three observation of Part I: 
1.It gets hotter as you get closer to the equator.  2. Now this season, the world is generally in the time of relatively high humidity, but there are still areas with zero humidity, the closer to the equator, the more such areas. 3. The current season is particularly good in areas around 20 to 40 north and south latitudes, but the northern latitudes are prone to rain because of the current summer season, so there are lots of clouds.

Difficult part:
1. In order to request the data from the citipy, we need to install the citipy and activate that, that takes me a while to find out how.
2. The last Vacation part, how to loop the hotel name in the table and put it on the marker in a certain form is a very difficult part, and it is basically difficult to find materials for reference.
3. Finding the hotel part was not hard, but I spent a lot of time figuring out that the word hotel wasn't recognized by Google at all, and then figuring out that I should have been lodging instead.

Easy part:

Although this is the most difficult assignment so far, it is relatively easy to complete this regression because the previous assignment did a lot of regression related coding. I still feel a sense of achievement.
